\section{Object Oriented Design}
    Object orientated programming is a very powerful concept but does not always lead to quality
    software. There are 5 principles that focus on dependency management to avoid code that
    is breakable, fragile and hard to maintain. This is why the SOLID \cite{Hotop2015} 
    principles of OOP should be applied.
    SOLID stands for :
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item 
            \textbf{S}ingle Responsibility Principle
        \item 
            \textbf{O}pen Closed Principle
        \item 
            \textbf{L}iskov Substitution Principle
        \item 
            \textbf{I}nterface Segregation Principle
        \item 
            \textbf{D}ependency Inversion Principle
    \end{enumerate}
    In the section below, I would like to describe in detail how the SOLID principles will 
    be designed in the navigation module. Not all principles are described due to
    limitation of the report but one can read up more here \cite{Hotop2015}.
