\section{Installing Android Things And Start New Project}
To get started with the project it is necessary to flash android things in the
microcontroller. The steps to install and run android things are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
        \textbf{Download and install the latest Android Things system image}
            follow the instructions in this \href{https://developer.android.com/things/console/create.html}
            {link}
    \item 
        \textbf{Build factory images that contain OEM applications along with the system image}
                Configure the android things product from this \href{https://developer.android.com/things/console/configure.html}
                {tutorial}
    \item 
    \textbf{Flash the image to raspberry pi}
        follow this you tube
        \href{https://youtu.be/9_ePSCjrQsQ?t=21}{tutorial} after the build is downloaded by following the previous steps.
        Note: This link starts from 0:21 and the process before this time is obsolete
        please do not follow the image downloading part form the tutorial.
        In case your SD card gets corrupted follow this \href{https://youtu.be/cguJpeDRfbc?list=PLr1nMHB-ifhF_3Q92jFqGUgqfABwFIKgZ}
        {tutorial}.               
    \item 
        \textbf{Download android studio}
            after downloading android studio either you can just make a android project 
            with an empty activity or use the template from this \href{https://github.com/androidthings/new-project-template}
            {link}.
            If you make choose to make your project with android studio instead of the
            template, make sure in the app/build.gradle file you have the android things
            dependency listed like the example \ref{code:gradleExample}.
    \item 
        \textbf{Connect to the internet to program the pi}
            internet is required to program the raspberry pi with android things.
            follow this \href{https://developer.android.com/things/hardware/raspberrypi.html}
            {link}.                                  
\end{enumerate}
