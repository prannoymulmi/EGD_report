\chapter{Conclusion}
    This work module presents the service which interfaces
    between the Google Direction API and the Raspberry pi 3
    to receive the raw data which would be used for navigation
    as mentioned in Section \ref{sec:introProblemStatement}.
    The module is realized using java as the programming 
    language and Android Things \cite{androidThings} as the
    operating environment. The software design aspects like
    object oriented design and MVP \cite{mvp} architecture 
    were kept in focus. This is done to achieve  
    better maintainability of the module.
