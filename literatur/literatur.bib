@article{Potel,
abstract = {Taligent, a wholly-owned subsidiary of IBM, is developing a next generation programming model for the C++ and Java programming languages, called Model-View-Presenter or MVP, based on a generalization of the classic MVC programming model of Smalltalk. MVP provides a powerful yet easy to understand design methodology for a broad range of application and component development tasks. Taligent's framework-based implementation of these concepts adds great value to developer programs that employ MVP. MVP also is adaptable across multiple client/server and multi-tier application architectures. MVP will enable IBM to deliver a unified conceptual programming model across all its major object-oriented language environments. Smalltalk Programming Model The most familiar example of a programming model is the Model-View-Controller (MVC) model 1 of Smalltalk developed at Xerox PARC in the late 1970's. MVC is the fundamental design pattern used in Smalltalk for implementing graphical user interface (GUI) objects, and it has been reused and adopted to varying degrees in most other GUI class libraries and application frameworks since.},
